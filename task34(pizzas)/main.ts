// Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array, 
// and then use a for 
// loop to print the name of each pizza.
// â€¢ Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the
//  name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple statement
//   like I like pepperoni pizza

//making an array
let pizzas:string[]=["tikka","cheesy","malai boti"];
for(let oneName of  pizzas){
console.log(`I like ${oneName} pizza`)
;}

//printing a statement
console.log('\n I love pizzza');
