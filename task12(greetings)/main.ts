//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
 //print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized
 // with the person’s name.

let names:string[] =["amna", "rabia", "wajiha", "laraib"];
console.log(`${names[0]} "give me something to eat"`); 
console.log(`${names[1]} "give me something to eat"`); 
console.log(`${names[2]} "give me something to eat"`); 
console.log(`${names[3]} "give me something to eat"`);
